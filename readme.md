# WikiPollia Front End

This is the front end for my [WikiPollia project](https://wikipollia.netlify.app/). A wireframe and other planning docs can be found [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/donovanrichardson/project-2/blob/master/project-worksheet.md).

## Search for Articles

Use the search bar in the bottom left to search for article titles on Wikipedia.

![Search for Lion in the bottom left](https://res.cloudinary.com/donovanrichardson/image/upload/c_crop,g_auto,h_639,w_1472,x_1472,y_857/v1601582135/Screen_Shot_2020-10-01_at_3.24.06_PM_rysnxk.png)

Click "Search", then choose your desired article from the article titles that appear. You can then use the upvote or downvote buttons to vote for the article. In the example below, the user selected Lionel Messi.

## Select Trending Articles

![Select Loona](https://res.cloudinary.com/donovanrichardson/image/upload/c_crop,g_south,h_639,w_1472,y_75/v1601583788/Screen_Shot_2020-10-01_at_3.24.59_PM_nka7h1.png)

By clicking on one of the trending articles at the right, you can set it as your selected article for upvoting or downvoting. The example user selected Loona from the trending articles and made it the selected article.

After upvoting, Loona has more votes! Vote on articles frequently to make them trend!
